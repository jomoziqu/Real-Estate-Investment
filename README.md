# Real-Estate-Investment

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices for a Real Estate Investor. The model will be trained using a dataset of historical house sales data in the Denton County, and will be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE).

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of 1048 rows of data, including features such as:

- House characteristics (e.g. number of bedrooms, square footage, fire places, pool, Age)
- Sale prices (target variable)

## Model:
The Algorithms used for this project are Linear Regression and Random Forest) trained using the scikit learn library.

## Evaluation Metrics:
The model will be evaluated using the following metric:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
